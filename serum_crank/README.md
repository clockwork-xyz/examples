## Devnet
TBD

## Localnet

The workflow is pretty similar with __devnet__ with the exception that you are running your own validator. So you need:
1. The `solana-test-validator` which should be installed by default with Solana.
2. Install and run the Clockwork Engine _(geyser plugin)_ with the `solana-test-validator`.


**0. Program Side - Preparing the Handler Program**

We start by defining an instruction to execute, that is the __"WHAT"__:
- We have already prepared a handler in `./programs/`.

**1. Validator Setup - Run the validator with Clockwork**
- Build and install the [Clockwork Engine](https://github.com/clockwork-xyz/clockwork#local-development)
- Run `./clockwork_localnet.sh` to start a local validator with the Clockwork Engine + Openbook Programs + Our 
  Handler Program from ðŸ‘†.

**2. Client Side - Creating a Thread**

Time to switch perspective, we need to do some work off-chain now, we will create a Thread, that's the __"HOW"__:
- Navigate to the `client` directory. _We have prepared a Rust client, but you
  can very well use any Solana client you prefer (JS, Python, etc)._
- Run `cargo run --features localnet`, this will create a __Thread__ that continuously calls your program handler, and so continously
  prints "Hello World".
